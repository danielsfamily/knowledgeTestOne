### Prep Work

- Create your own repository called KnowledgeTestOne
- COPY the contents of this folder into the repository you jave created
- Do an initial commit on your repository before you start your work
  (NOTE: The steps to commit and push are the following:
  git add .
  git commit -m "commit message"
  git push
  )

### Task 1 - Research

(NOTE: FOR THIS SECTION WRITE YOUR ANSWERs IN A COMMENT in your Javascript and title it Research Tasks. Above each answer copy the question. example bellow)

EXAMPLE:

```
// Research Tasks
/*
* What are the Primitive data types?
* this is my answer to the question above
*
* What are the Reference(Complex) data types we discussed in class?
* Here's a list of reference data types for the question above.
*
* questions continued...
*/
```

- What are the Primitive data types?

- What are the Reference(Complex) data types we discussed in class?

- What is the Spread Operator?

- Research the Math object in Javascript and tell me three of the methods you find and their use.

- Research the Array Methods in Javascript and tell me three of the methods you find and their use.

- Research the String Methods in Javascript and tell me three of the methods you find and their use.

- Does a string have indexes?

- How do we access different items in an Array?

- how do we access different properties in an Object?

- how do you check a strings length?

- how do you check an arrays length?

### Task 2 - Initialization

- Initialize a variable called firstName with your first name
- Initialize a variable called lastName with your last name
- Initialize a variable called lovesToCode with a boolean value

### Task 3 - Creating a function

- Create a function that is given the first and last name then returns the fullname of the person
- Initialize the returned value of the function to a variable called fullName.

### Task 4: Objects and Arrays

- Initialize a `book` object and give it the following three properties: title, author, publishedYear. The book information you will have to look up is `Ready Player One`

- Initialize a `movie` object and give it the following three properties: title, director, releaseYear. The movie information you will have to look up is `Inception`

- Initialize a `student` object and give it the following three properties: name, age, grades. The student information is your self. The `grades` property should be an array of the following 3 number grades: 85, 90, 92.

### Task 5: Functions with Conditional Statements

(NOTE: These exercises are to practice taking a text based ticketing and converting it to code.)

- Create a function named `findBiggestNumber` that is given the 2 parameters(num1 and num2) and returns the biggest number.

- Create a function named `checkStringsLength` that is given the 2 parameters(str and maxLength) and returns `Too Long` if the strings length is greater than the `maxLength` or returns `Within Limit` if the string is less than or equal to maxLength.
